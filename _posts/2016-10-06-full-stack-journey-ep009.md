This episode is a very special episode of the Full Stack Journey podcast, recorded live at the Dallas-Ft. Worth VMUG UserCon on Thursday, September 29, 2016. This special episode continues our series of looking at individual technologies that are necessary steps along the "full-stack journey." Joining Scott on this episode is Jake Robinson (@jakerobinson [on Twitter][link-10] as well as [on GitHub][link-11]), an automation specialist at VMware, Inc. Naturally, the conversation centers on automation, why automation is important, and getting started with automation.

Enough introductions, let's jump right in!

## Show Notes

* Jake is a development manager for Project Zombie, an orchestration framework that drives a lot of the automation behind VMware's vCloud Air service.
* Having automation is important, but scale of one's learning ability is also important.
* The rise of the software-defined data center has also given rise to a new archetype, the "data center developer," who leverages automation tools, APIs, scripting languages, etc., to programmatically define and orchestrate resources within a software-defined data center.
* Automation is driven by business needs---to move more quickly, to stay ahead of the competition. The business needs demand that we (IT professionals) are able to deliver software and/or infrastructure more quickly and more consistently.
* Jake finds that learning happens best when centered around a "problem," a key thing you're trying to solve. This is especially true for automation and/or learning programming/scripting languages.
* [PowerCLI][link-2] is an outstanding interface to vSphere, and offers a really easy learning curve for folks getting started in automation.
* Running reports--like listing all the VMs in your environment, or something similar---is a useful way to get started with PowerCLI.
* So how does one help build "programmatic thinking" skills?
    * [CodeAcademy][link-3] is a good tool you can use to interactively play with various languages, and allows you to build your "programmatic thinking" skills.
    * [Scratch][link-4] is another tool, oriented a bit more towards children, that can be used to help build "programmatic thinking" skills. The [board game Robot Turtles][link-5] is another tool (again oriented toward children).
    * Using these kid-centric tools offers a secondary purpose as well: it helps encourage your kids to be involved in developing these sorts of skills in a way that also helps promote work-life balance.
* It's OK to admit you don't know something, and ask the "dumb question." You just have to be brave enough to ask the question.
* [IFTTT.com][link-6] is another, easy-to-use way to build programmatic thinking and incorporating automation into your regular workflows.
* Learning automation doesn't necessarily have to be data center-focused.
* Along the lines of "low-hanging fruit" that listeners can tackle as an easy first project, reports (as mentioned earlier) are a great way to get started.
    * Start with simple reports on your VMs.
    * Then add more information.
    * Next, add some formatting of the output.
    * You can then have the report delivered to you via e-mail on a regular basis.
    * As you can see, you can start small and build upon your success as you go.
* Digging into other peoples' code can be helpful in your own learning journey.
* While your early code doesn't have to be perfect, you do have to balance the accrual of [technical debt][link-7].
    * Don't have expectations that are too high for your early code projects. Every task you automate is a learning process, and your code will get better over time.
    * Set reasonable goals for yourself.
    * It can be helpful to break a larger problem down into a number of smaller problems. This goes back to "programmatic thinking" (being able to break a problem down into the steps required to fix a problem).
* DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
* Don't expect to write perfectly DRY code in the beginning---give yourself room to learn and get better over time.
* For Jake, learning the language was the easy part, and those skills tend to apply themselves to other programming languages. The hard part was the associated "tooling" that accompanies a language.
* Practice, practice, practice---it's the only way to get better. There's no easy road. It will take effort in order to improve.
* Other tools that might be helpful:
    * Online communities (don't be afraid to ask the "dumb" questions!) are a good resource.
    * When it comes to communities, you'll get out of it what you put into it.
    * In-person meetups can also be helpful.
* Keep in mind that automation takes many forms---not just scripting.
* Determine the right tool to use, and then you can find resources to help learn/use that tool.
* What is the best tool to use/learn? "It depends." Of course! A few resources that Jake likes:
    * [Puppet][link-8] is a good tool for managing desired state of a node.
    * Maybe combine a tool like [Ansible][link-9] (for orchestrating multiple tasks) and Puppet for managing node state.
    * Of course, there's also PowerCLI, as mentioned earlier.
* If you're new to "programmatic thinking," use some of the tools described earlier to help build those skills.
* If you're familiar with a scripting language, push yourself to learn a new language, new tool, or new framework.
