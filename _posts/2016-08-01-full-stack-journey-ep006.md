Episode 6 is a bit different than the previous 5 episodes. There's no guest on this episode; it's just me (Scott, the host) talking about what was shared in the first five episodes, and reflecting on what this means. What was the conclusion? Sorry, no spoilers here---you'll have to listen to the episode (available [via iTunes][link-1] or [downloadable directly from S3][link-2]) for all the details.

Thanks for listening!
