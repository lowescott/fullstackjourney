That's right, the Full Stack Journey podcast has moved! We're now part of the Packet Pushers network of podcasts. You can read more about the move over [here at the Packet Pushers site][link-3].

Moving forward, all new episodes will be published via Packet Pushers. The landing page for the Full Stack Journey podcast is [here][link-1], so check there for new episodes. Right now, we're in the process of publishing old episodes so that the feed doesn't get overloaded.

We'll continue to maintain the [Full Stack Journey Twitter account][link-2], so follow that account if you want to stay up-to-date on the transition to the Packet Pushers or news about new episodes.

Thanks for listening!
