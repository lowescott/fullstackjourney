The Full Stack Journey Podcast is a monthly podcast discussing the ongoing journey toward becoming a "full stack engineer." Each month, we'll talk with a guest who will describe his or her own personal journey toward becoming a full stack engineer, and will share with listeners any tips, tricks, or advice they think may be useful.

## What is a full stack engineer?

A full stack engineer is an engineer who is capable of moving among multiple layers and multiple silos within the modern data center technology stack. That's not to say that a full stack engineer will be an expert in all these areas (though that would be quite the feat!). Instead, a full stack engineer will have significant experience or expertise in one or two major technology areas along with reasonable knowledge of or proficiency in multiple other areas. Further, a full stack engineer will actively work toward tearing down silos, encouraging cross-team communications and cooperation for the benefit of their organization.
